# Summary 

From our data we can tell what our temperatures are but since there are other attributes to the weather such as precipitation it shows that we can run additional queries to let us know whether or not people can come and visit the shop. 
If we are able to gain more data for the area we can run even more queries! 
From there we can decide how we would like to build the shop and what areas would make this a more prominent location for visitors to visit.
