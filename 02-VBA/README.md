## Summary

Compare the code ran in seconds for particular year.



Advantage of refactoring code is that it is easy to use and the fastest way for results. Greater velocity.
Your code will be better organized after refactoring, though by definition, it won't be any more functional than it was before the changes. 
Refactoring is just to change the structure of the code base, not its behavior.

Disadvantage is that You have to know which code to use. Greater risk. 
You can potentially introduce bugs that your tests won't catch. 
Remember that any time you make a change, there is a potential to introduce a bug.


update or improvement of the code without changing the software’s functionality is known as code refactoring. 
What happens after a couple of days or months yo need to troubleshoot your code? Is it hard to understand? 
If yes then definitely you didn’t pay attention to improve or update your code.

We need to consider the code refactoring process as cleaning up the orderly house. Unnecessary clutter in a home can create a chaotic and stressful environment. - The same goes for written code.

It's always easy to understand, change and to update the clean and well structured code.
