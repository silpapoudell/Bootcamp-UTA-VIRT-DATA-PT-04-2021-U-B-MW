# UFO Sightings with JavaScript 



## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to build a dynamic table using JavaScript and incorporate it into a web site using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
The aim of this module is to create multiple search criteria in addition to the date filter we created in this module. 
When a user enters the search criteria the app.js will store the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed and then filter the dataset and keep only the data that matches search criteria. 
The search criteria will will be rendered on the webapge.


## Results:

The updatefilter function saves the element, values and the id of filter and then filterTable function loops through all of the filters and keeps any data that matched filter values. 
The webpage filters the table correctly based on user input. 

## Summary:

Styles are verbose and can lead to lots of output in HTML which is not needed. 

Can add pre-defined class to make it more responsive. 
Most of the Webpages created using bootstrap look alike, so we have to look into it to resolved this issue.
